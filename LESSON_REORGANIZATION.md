# Lesson Reorganization Summary

## Problem Identified.

The original "Getting Started with Ethical Hacking" lesson (lesson-01.md) was messy and disorganized:

❌ **Issues**:
- Mixed multiple unrelated topics in one file
- Jumped between setup, wireless adapters, and RSA encryption
- No clear structure or flow
- Difficult to navigate
- Hard to find specific information
- RSA encryption didn't belong in "getting started"

## Solution Implemented

Created a dedicated **Getting Started Page** with organized sections and broke content into focused, individual lessons.

## New Structure
