# Hacking Tutorial

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive tutorial series for ethical hacking and penetration testing. It is designed for learners who want to understand the principles, tools, and techniques used in network security, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity research. The tutorials cover both theoretical concepts and practical hands-on exercises.

## What You'll Learn

- Network scanning and information gathering
- Pre-connection and post-connection attacks
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
- Device discovery and ARP spoofing
- Using tools like Nmap, Netdiscover, ARP Scan, and more
- Python scripting for automating security tasks
- Best practices for ethical hacking and responsible disclosure

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amandewatnitrr/hacking-tutorial.git
   cd hacking-tutorial
   ```

2. **Explore the lessons:**
   - Lessons are organized in the `ethical-hacking/` and `python-for-eth-hacking/` folders.
   - Each lesson contains step-by-step instructions, code samples, and explanations.

3. **Try the scripts:**
   - Example scripts are available in the `python-scripts/` directory.
   - Use a safe, isolated environment (such as a VM or test network) for all practical exercises.

## Analytics & Privacy Guidelines

If you want to add analytics or visitor tracking to the site, please follow these guidelines:

- Only use analytics services that respect user privacy, e.g., Plausible or Fathom.
- Do **not** collect sensitive user information.
- Clearly inform users if any tracking is enabled.
- Follow GDPR/CCPA rules if your users are in regions that require them.
- Any analytics code should be added in a separate, well-commented file (e.g., `analytics.js`) and imported only in production.

Example (using Plausible):

```js
// src/analytics.js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  (function() {
    var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
    s.src = 'https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js';
    s.async = true; s.defer = true; s.setAttribute('data-domain', 'yourdomain.com');
    d.head.appendChild(s);
  })();
}
```

## Security Warning

**Avoid using the `python_crypto` library or any other cryptographic or hacking-related libraries that are unmaintained, deprecated, or suspicious.**

- Always use reputable, well-maintained libraries and tools.
- If you are unsure about a dependency, open an issue or ask before using it.
