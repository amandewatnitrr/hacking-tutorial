## üîç Asynchronous Port Scanner

A small, educational port scanner written in Python that demonstrates:

- **Asynchronous networking** using `asyncio` (no external dependencies).
- **Banner grabbing**: reading the short messages services often send when you connect.
- **Basic service fingerprinting**: using simple pattern matches to guess common services (HTTP, SSH, SMTP, MySQL, etc.).

### Architecture and Flow

The diagram below shows the end-to-end sequence: CLI parsing, host collection, async scheduling with a semaphore, banner grabbing, fingerprinting, and result collection/output.

![Async Port Scanner Architecture](images/async_port_scanner_flow_edges.jpg)

### Key Features
- Uses `async`/`await` and an event loop to run many connections concurrently without threads
- `asyncio.Semaphore` limits concurrent tasks to avoid exhausting system resources
- Matches banners against simple regexes for common services
- Falls back to a port-to-service map if no banner match is found

### Usage

```bash
python port_scanner.py --hosts 127.0.0.1 --ports 22,80,443
```

### Example Output

## üîß Core Functionality

### Asynchronous Port Scanner

#### How it Works
- **asyncio**: Uses `async`/`await` and an event loop to run many connections concurrently without threads
- **Banner Grabbing**: After connect, reads up to N bytes with a timeout; for HTTP, sends a `HEAD /` probe
- **Service Fingerprinting**: Matches banners against simple regexes for common services (HTTP, SSH, SMTP, MySQL)

#### Technical Implementation
- `asyncio.Semaphore` limits concurrent tasks to avoid exhausting system resources
- `asyncio.gather` schedules many scan tasks together
- Falls back to a port-to-service map if no banner match is found

### Bettercap Controller

#### Device Discovery Module
```python
def discover_devices(proc):
    """
    Orchestrates network device discovery using Bettercap's net.probe functionality.
    Implements threaded output reading for non-blocking operation.
    """
```

#### Attack Execution Engine
```python
def run_attack(proc, targets, fullduplex):
    """
    Constructs and executes the coordinated attack command sequence.
    Manages real-time output streaming and graceful termination.
    """
```

#### Bettercap Command Integration
- **`net.probe`**: Active network reconnaissance and device enumeration
- **`net.show`**: Device list parsing and metadata extraction  
- **`arp.spoof`**: ARP spoofing attack coordination with configurable parameters
- **`net.sniff`**: Packet capture and real-time traffic analysis

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### Professional Use Only

These tools are designed for authorized security professionals, educators, and students working in controlled environments. Users must:

- ‚úÖ **Obtain explicit written authorization** before any testing
- ‚úÖ **Use only in isolated laboratory environments** for unauthorized testing
- ‚úÖ **Maintain detailed logs and documentation** of all activities
- ‚úÖ **Follow applicable local, state, and federal laws** regarding network security testing
- ‚úÖ **Respect privacy and confidentiality** of any intercepted data

### Recommended Testing Environment

- Virtual machine networks (VMware, VirtualBox)
- Isolated physical test networks
- Dedicated cybersecurity training laboratories
- Home networks with proper consent from all users

### Security Considerations

#### Authorization Requirements
- **Authorized Networks Only**: Only use on networks you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Laboratory Environment**: Ideal for isolated testing environments and educational labs
- **Documentation**: Maintain proper documentation and approval records

#### Detection and Countermeasures
- **ARP Table Monitoring**: Network administrators can detect ARP spoofing through table analysis
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection**: Enterprise switches can validate ARP traffic automatically
- **Static ARP Entries**: Manual ARP table configuration prevents spoofing attacks
- **Network Monitoring**: Tools like `arpwatch` can identify suspicious ARP behavior
