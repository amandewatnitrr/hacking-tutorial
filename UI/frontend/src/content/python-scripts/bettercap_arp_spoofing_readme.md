## üõ°Ô∏è Bettercap Controller

A professional Python automation script for controlling **Bettercap** operations, including device discovery, target selection, and ARP spoofing workflows.

### Features

- **Automated Bettercap Management**: Launches and controls Bettercap as a subprocess
- **Interactive Device Discovery**: Uses `net.probe` to discover network devices automatically
- **User-Friendly Target Selection**: Intuitive interface for selecting attack targets
- **Flexible Attack Configuration**: Supports both simplex and full-duplex ARP spoofing
- **Real-time Output Streaming**: Live display of Bettercap operations and captured data
- **Professional Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and graceful cleanup

### System Architecture

The script follows a structured workflow with clear separation of concerns and professional error handling.

### Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: Validates arguments and launches Bettercap subprocess
2. **Device Discovery**: Executes `net.probe` to scan the local network
3. **Target Selection**: Parses discovered devices and presents selection interface  
4. **Attack Configuration**: Configures ARP spoofing parameters based on user input
5. **Operation Execution**: Launches coordinated ARP spoofing and packet sniffing
6. **Real-time Monitoring**: Streams live output with proper cleanup handling

### Usage

```bash
# Standard Ethernet interface
python bettercap_controller.py eth0

# Wireless interface  
python bettercap_controller.py wlan0
```

### Live Demonstration

Below is a screenshot from an actual test session showing the script in operation:

The demonstration shows:
- **Device Discovery Phase**: Automatic network scanning and device enumeration
- **Interactive Selection**: User-friendly target selection interface
- **Real-time Operations**: Live ARP spoofing and packet capture output
- **Professional Logging**: Structured output with timestamps and status indicators

## üîß Core Functionality

### Bettercap Controller

#### Device Discovery Module
```python
def discover_devices(proc):
    """
    Orchestrates network device discovery using Bettercap's net.probe functionality.
    Implements threaded output reading for non-blocking operation.
    """
```

#### Attack Execution Engine
```python
def run_attack(proc, targets, fullduplex):
    """
    Constructs and executes the coordinated attack command sequence.
    Manages real-time output streaming and graceful termination.
    """
```

#### Bettercap Command Integration
- **`net.probe`**: Active network reconnaissance and device enumeration
- **`net.show`**: Device list parsing and metadata extraction  
- **`arp.spoof`**: ARP spoofing attack coordination with configurable parameters
- **`net.sniff`**: Packet capture and real-time traffic analysis

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### Professional Use Only

These tools are designed for authorized security professionals, educators, and students working in controlled environments. Users must:

- ‚úÖ **Obtain explicit written authorization** before any testing
- ‚úÖ **Use only in isolated laboratory environments** for unauthorized testing
- ‚úÖ **Maintain detailed logs and documentation** of all activities
- ‚úÖ **Follow applicable local, state, and federal laws** regarding network security testing
- ‚úÖ **Respect privacy and confidentiality** of any intercepted data

### Recommended Testing Environment

- Virtual machine networks (VMware, VirtualBox)
- Isolated physical test networks
- Dedicated cybersecurity training laboratories
- Home networks with proper consent from all users

### Security Considerations

#### Authorization Requirements
- **Authorized Networks Only**: Only use on networks you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Laboratory Environment**: Ideal for isolated testing environments and educational labs
- **Documentation**: Maintain proper documentation and approval records

#### Detection and Countermeasures
- **ARP Table Monitoring**: Network administrators can detect ARP spoofing through table analysis
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection**: Enterprise switches can validate ARP traffic automatically
- **Static ARP Entries**: Manual ARP table configuration prevents spoofing attacks
- **Network Monitoring**: Tools like `arpwatch` can identify suspicious ARP behavior
