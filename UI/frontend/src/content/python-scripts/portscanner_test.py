"""
python-scripts/portscanner_test.py

A self-contained demo that starts lightweight local test servers (HTTP, SSH-like,
SMTP greeting, and a MySQL-like handshake), runs the AsyncPortScanner against them,
and prints the JSON results and a short human-readable summary.

Purpose for learners:
- Demonstrates how to run the async scanner in a safe, local environment.
- Shows how banner-grabbing works against services that proactively send greetings,
  and against HTTP where we send a light HEAD probe.
- Provides easy-to-copy commands to reproduce the proof-of-work for a PR.

IMPORTANT:
- This demo binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) on ports above 1024 (no root required).
- Only run on your machine or in an isolated VM. Do not point this demo at external targets.
