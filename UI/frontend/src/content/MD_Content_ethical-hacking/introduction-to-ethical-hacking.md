## What is Hacking?

**Hacking** is the practice of gaining unauthorized access to a computer system, network, or data. While the term often carries negative connotations, hacking itself is a neutral skill that can be used for both good and malicious purposes.

## Types of Hackers

Hackers are generally categorized into three main types based on their intentions and ethics:

### 🎩 Black Hat Hackers
- **Intent**: Malicious
- **Activities**: 
  - Steal sensitive information
  - Cause damage to systems
  - Deploy ransomware
  - Sell stolen data
- **Legal Status**: Illegal activities
- **Motivation**: Financial gain, revenge, or chaos

### 🤠 White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)
- **Intent**: Beneficial
- **Activities**:
  - Test system security
  - Find and report vulnerabilities
  - Help organizations improve security
  - Conduct authorized penetration tests
- **Legal Status**: Legal with proper authorization
- **Motivation**: Security improvement, education, career

### 🎭 Grey Hat Hackers
- **Intent**: Mixed
- **Activities**:
  - Find vulnerabilities without permission
  - Report issues to organizations
  - Don't cause damage or steal data
  - May request payment for disclosure
- **Legal Status**: Legally questionable
- **Motivation**: Recognition, curiosity, sometimes financial

## What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical Hacking** is the authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. Ethical hackers use the same techniques as malicious hackers but with permission and for the purpose of improving security.

### Key Principles of Ethical Hacking

1. **Authorization**: Always get written permission before testing
2. **Scope**: Stay within the agreed-upon boundaries
3. **Confidentiality**: Keep findings private and secure
4. **Reporting**: Document and report all vulnerabilities
5. **No Harm**: Don't damage systems or steal data

## Why Learn Ethical Hacking?
